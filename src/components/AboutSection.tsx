        <p className='mb-4'>
          I&#x27;m a full stack software engineer with a passion for technology.
          I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design by combining
          my technical knowledge with my love for design to create a beautiful
          product. My goal is to build applications that are efficient,
          reliable, and scalable while providing engaging and memorable user
          experiences.
        </p>

          When I&#x27;m not busy with my tech adventures, I have a few hobbies
          to keep me grounded. You&#x27;ll often find me biking with friends,
          keeping fit with Crossfit, or traveling with my camera, always ready
          to capture those special moments.
        </p>
